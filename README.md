## Summary

> Between 2010-2018 internet traffic grew ten-fold and is expected to double
> again by 2022. With video streaming making up 60% of that traffic, 65% on
> mobile, it is important to understand its energy consumption. Here we provide
> updated figures for the energy consumption of different sections of the
> internet by using observations from volunteers of home internet routing over
> Wi-Fi and 4G connections, then use survey and industry estimates to calculate
> the network energy intensity of video streaming. We estimate 39.2bn hours of
> video were streamed in the UK in 2019 generating 76.2 EB of data and
> consuming a total of 4.2 TWh of electricity, or 1.3% of total electricity
> generation. By connection type, energy consumption was split 1.1 TWh over 4G
> and 3.1 TWh over Wi-Fi. Video streaming over 4G is twice as energy intensive
> per streaming hour (0.210 kWh/hr) compared to Wi-Fi (0.091 kWh/hr).
