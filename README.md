## Summary

> Between 2010-2018 internet traffic grew ten-fold and is expected to double
> again by 2022. With video streaming making up 60% of that traffic, 65% on
> mobile, it is important to understand its energy consumption. Here we provide 
> updated figures for the energy consumption of different sections of the internet 
> by using observations from volunteers of home internet routing over Wi-Fi and 
> 4G connections, then use survey and industry estimates to calculate the 
> network energy intensity of video streaming. We estimate the 2019 network energy
> footprint of the UKâ€™s 39 billion hours of video streaming at 4.2 TWh, or 1.3%
> of total electricity generation. We show that the network energy intensity of
> video streaming over Wi-Fi is 0.091 kWh/hour, compared to 0.207 kWh/hour over
> 4G mobile internet.
